- Design layouts mobile-first, then progressively scale up to larger screens.
- Use flexible grids, relative units (%, em, rem), and fluid images.
- Test touch interactions (tap targets, scroll, gestures) across devices.
- Ensure text remains legible with scalable typography.
- Avoid fixed pixel dimensions that break layouts on smaller screens.
