# üìà StockAlert - User Guide

Welcome to **StockAlert**! This application monitors stock prices in real-time and sends you Windows notifications when prices cross your custom thresholds.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows Defender / SmartScreen Warning

When installing, you may see a Windows Defender or SmartScreen warning. **This is normal for new applications** that don't have a code signing certificate yet.

**Why this happens:**
- StockAlert is a new application without widespread distribution
- It's not digitally signed with an expensive code signing certificate
- Windows is being cautious with unfamiliar software

**StockAlert is safe:**
- ‚úÖ Open source - you can review all code
- ‚úÖ No network activity except Yahoo Finance API
- ‚úÖ No data collection or telemetry
- ‚úÖ No admin privileges required
- ‚úÖ Scanned by VirusTotal (0 detections)

**To install anyway:**

1. **If you see "Windows protected your PC":**
   - Click **"More info"**
   - Click **"Run anyway"**

2. **If Windows Defender blocks it:**
   - Click **"Show more"** or **"Actions"**
   - Select **"Allow on device"**

3. **If still blocked:**
   - Open **Windows Security**
   - Go to **Virus & threat protection** ‚Üí **Protection history**
   - Find StockAlert and select **"Allow"**

**Future versions will be code-signed to eliminate these warnings.**

## üîî Understanding Notifications

### When You'll Get Alerts

You'll receive a Windows Toast notification when:
- Stock price crosses **above** your high threshold
- Stock price crosses **below** your low threshold

### Cooldown Period

After an alert is sent, the same stock won't alert again until the cooldown period expires. This prevents notification spam if a stock price hovers around your threshold.

**Example:**
- AAPL high threshold: $190
- Cooldown: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- If AAPL hits $191, you get an alert
- Even if AAPL stays at $191, you won't get another alert for 5 minutes

### Clicking Notifications

Click on a notification to open the stock's chart on Yahoo Finance in your web browser.

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Setting Good Thresholds

1. **Check current price first** on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)
2. **Set realistic thresholds** based on typical price movements
3. **Update regularly** as stock prices change over time

**Example:**
- Current AAPL price: $185
- Set high threshold: $190 (alert if it goes up $5)
- Set low threshold: $180 (alert if it drops $5)

### Managing Multiple Stocks

- Start with 2-3 stocks to test
- Add more once you're comfortable
- Use the **Enabled** checkbox to temporarily disable stocks

### Check Interval Recommendations

- **Day trading:** 10-30 seconds (very frequent)
- **Active monitoring:** 60 seconds (default)
- **Casual watching:** 300-600 seconds (5-10 minutes)

### Cooldown Recommendations

- **Frequent updates:** 60-180 seconds
- **Balanced (default):** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Minimal alerts:** 600-1800 seconds (10-30 minutes)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Notifications Appearing?

**Check Windows Settings:**
1. Open **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Notifications**
2. Ensure notifications are enabled
3. Find **StockAlert** in the app list
4. Make sure it has notification permission

**Check App Settings:**
1. Open **StockAlert Configuration**
2. Go to **Settings** tab
3. Ensure **Notifications Enabled** is checked

**Verify Thresholds:**
- Make sure your thresholds make sense for current prices
- Check if cooldown period is blocking alerts (see console output)

### "No data available" Error?

- ‚úÖ Check your internet connection
- ‚úÖ Verify the stock symbol on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)
- ‚úÖ Try again (API can be slow sometimes)
- ‚úÖ Note: Some international stocks may not be available

### Symbol Validation Fails?

- Use official ticker symbols (e.g., `AAPL` not `Apple`)
- Search on Yahoo Finance first to find the correct symbol
- Some stocks may not be available through the API

### App Crashes on Startup?

**Check config.json:**
1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\StockAlert`
2. Delete `config.json`
3. Restart the app (it will recreate from example)

**Or use the config editor:**
1. Open **StockAlert Configuration**
2. Fix any invalid settings
3. Save and try again

### Console Window Closes Immediately?

This usually means there's a configuration error. To see the error:
1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
2. Navigate to: `cd "C:\Program Files\StockAlert"`
3. Run: `.\StockAlert.exe`
4. Read the error message

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Editing config.json Manually

The configuration file is in JSON format. You can edit it with Notepad:

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "check_interval": 60,
    "cooldown": 300,
    "notifications_enabled": true
  },
  "tickers": [
    {
      "symbol": "AAPL",
      "name": "Apple Inc.",
      "high_threshold": 190.0,
      "low_threshold": 180.0,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**After editing manually:**
- Save the file
- Restart StockAlert for changes to take effect

### Backing Up Your Configuration

1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\StockAlert`
2. Copy `config.json` to a safe location
3. To restore: Copy it back and restart the app

### Market Hours Detection (Automatic!)

**Good news:** StockAlert automatically knows when the market is open!

**US Market Hours (Eastern Time):**
- Regular hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM (Mon-Fri)
- Pre-market: 4:00 AM - 9:30 AM
- After-hours: 4:00 PM - 8:00 PM
- Closed: Nights, weekends, holidays

**How it works:**
- When market is **open**: Monitors stocks every 60 seconds (or your configured interval)
- When market is **closed**: Sleeps and uses almost no resources
- Automatically wakes up when market opens
- Includes US market holiday calendar (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.)

### Running at Startup (Recommended!)

‚úÖ **Recommended** - Let StockAlert run 24/7 in the background!

**Automatic Installation Script:**

1. Navigate to `C:\Program Files\StockAlert`
2. Right-click `install_startup.ps1`
3. Select **Run with PowerShell**
4. Approve the prompt

**Manual Installation:**

1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type: `shell:startup` and press Enter
3. Create a shortcut to `C:\Program Files\StockAlert\StockAlert.exe`
4. Place the shortcut in the Startup folder

**Result:** StockAlert starts automatically when you log in, runs in the system tray, and only monitors during market hours!
